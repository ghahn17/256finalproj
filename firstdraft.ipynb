    "create a program where a user can input a outdoor activity and a location, or the program will fetch their current location and will display information and photos for outdoor recreation locations including hiking and mountain biking trails, campgrounds, ski resorts, ATV trails, and more. The program will return trail length, yes/no if there is parking, the distance from their input location.The data returned will be organzied neatly on the page fpr the user to access easily and visually appealing. From there, a user can get more information on the trail/location itself and be directed to more information about the place. I will use information from previous labs and use an api key from rapid api ot create this. The api key will be helpful because i can use dictionaries to categorize the information and the locate it when the location and activity is called. my end product i am hoping to make it look pretty with displays and widgets. The api key i am getting from rapid api has endpoints and urls listed on the site and and contains categories to make the data into smaller lists and even the possibility of dictionaries. I am hoping that my program is able to combine all of my skills learned this semester and then properly apply them to this project. \n"
